# Summary

OpenKeyS is an OpenBSD machine that is vulnerable to the the OpenBSD authentication vulnerabilites which allow an attacker to bypass authentication and escalate privileges. We first bypass the authentication on the webpage and get the user's private `SSH` key using which we are able to log in and then escalate privileges.

# NMAP

The NMAP scan reveals the following:

```bash

# PORT 80

Checking port 80 reveals a login page which doesn't appear to be vulnerable to `SQLI`.

Fuzzing the directories give us the following output.

```

We see an interesting includes directory which contains two files: `auth.php` and `auth.php.swp.` 

Downloading and opening the `auth.php.swp` file reveals the following:

```
return True; $_SESSION['last_activity'] = $time; // Session is active, update last activity time and return True { else } return False; close_session(); { ($time - $_SESSION['last_activity']) > $session_timeout) if (isset($_SESSION['last_activity']) && $time = $_SERVER['REQUEST_TIME']; // Has the session expired? { if(isset($_SESSION["logged_in"])) // Is the user logged in? session_start(); // Start the session $session_timeout = 300; // Session timeout in seconds{function is_active_session()} return $retcode; system($cmd, $retcode); $cmd = escapeshellcmd("../auth_helpers/check_auth " . $username . " " . $password);{function authenticate($username, $password)
```

The above code checks the `SESSION` variable `username` which is set using `$_REQUEST['username'].` The `$_REQUEST` variable accepts data through POST, GET and COOKIE. So if we set a cookie with the username `jennifer` found in the script, it will set the username for the session as the one specified in the cookie.

Further reading through the code reveals a `../auth_helpers/check_auth` binary which can be downloaded. However, it is not of much use for us just yet.

We have a few bits of information by now:

- Username: `jennifer`
- OpenBSD httpd server: `NMAP SCAN`

Now we just need to see if we can find a vulnerability in the server with something related to `authentication` as it has been mentioned a lot in the script.

Googling around for `openbsd authentication http vulnerability` show a few vulnerability reports for the OpenBSD authentication system which are not specifically used for HTTP authentication. 

[](https://www.qualys.com/2019/12/04/cve-2019-19521/authentication-vulnerabilities-openbsd.txt)

However, reading further reading reveals that the vulnerability exists in the OpenBSD's authentication system itself. 

> We discovered an authentication-bypass vulnerability in OpenBSD's
authentication system: this vulnerability is remotely exploitable in
smtpd, ldapd, and radiusd, but its real-world impact should be studied
on a case-by-case basis. For example, sshd is not exploitable thanks to
its defense-in-depth mechanisms.

Reading further also reveals that the vulnerability exists in the challenge protocol of the authentication system. Specifying the username `-schallenge` forces a passwd style authentication and automatically bypasses the authentication.

## Exploitation

We now know that using the username `-schallenge` while logging in will just automatically bypass the login. However trying to do that gives us the following error:

```
OpenSSH key not found for user -schallenge
```

Going back to the username jennifer that we found from our earlier findings we set the cookie `username` to `jennifer` as the variable `$_REQUEST` will accept a username through COOKIE, GET or POST.

Doing the above logs us in as jennifer and presents us with the ssh key for the user.

# Privilege Escalation

After logging in with the ssh key we can grab the user flag.

Further reading through the article, the author outlines ways to escalate privileges through `xlock` and `S/Key and YubiKey`. 

Futher readings:

[xlock(1) - OpenBSD manual pages](https://man.openbsd.org/xlock)

Following the article step by step we open our own driver and gain the permissions with the group `auth` which can then be used to exploit `CVE-2019-19522` where we need to make sure that the authentication type of either `yubikey` or `skey` has been enabled.

We can check the following in the `/etc/login.conf` with the line `auth-defaults:auth=passwd,skey:` this reveals that we can use this exploit.

Following the exploit step by step gives us root.

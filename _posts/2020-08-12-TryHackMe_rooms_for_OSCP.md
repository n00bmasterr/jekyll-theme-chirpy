A list of rooms that I have come accross + more reccomended by others that are a good pre oscp prep. 

# Rooms and paths
## Paths

1. `Offensive Security Path` - Unsurprisingly this one makes it on the list as the Offensive Security path was meant to prepare students for the OSCP.
2. `Primer Series Path` - Contains an introduction to a lot of the most common tools.
3. `Complete Beginner` - Goes from the very basics of scripting, researching and web/network security.

# Lian Yu

Lian yu is a beginner level room on tryhackme based around the TV show The Green Arrow. 
This machine requires a lot of fuzzing, stego and sudo privilege abuse

### Nmap
 The nmap scan reveals the following:

### Webserver
 Running gobuster reveals that there is a /island directory and checking the source reveals the following:

 Doing further fuzzing on the /island directory with the 0000-9999 4 digits wordlist from seclists we are able to find the following

 Reading the source code on the webpage reveals the following:

 This hints the file extension of .ticket that can be used to do more fuzzing, using the medium directory list we are able to retrieve the green_arrow.ticket file.

 Base58 decoding the text reveals a password and using the username "vigilante" found earlier logs us in to the ftp server.

### FTP
 Checking the ftp server reveals a lot of image files and an .other_users file.

### Stego
 Using stegcracker on the aa.jpg file with rockyou.txt wordlist reveals the password "password" and using steghide with that password extracts a ss.zip file.

### SSH
 Unzipping and checking the contents of ss.zip reveals a shado and passwd.txt file that contain the password, checking the .other_users file reveals the username slade.
 We can use the password in shado and slade as username we can log in to ssh.

### Privilege Escalation
 Using sudo -l we can see that the user slade can execute /usr/bin/pkexec as root

 The binary pkexec allows the user to execute programs/files as other users. 

 In order to escalate privs we can just create a shell.sh file with the following contents.

 Use sudo pkexec /tmp/shell.sh drops a root shell.
